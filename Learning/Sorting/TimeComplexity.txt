// Time complexity for all sorting algorithm
1. Bubble Sort => O(n^2) --- SC => O(1)
2. Selection Sort => O(n^2) --- SC => O(1)
3. Insertion Sort => O(n^2) --- SC => O(1)
4. Merge Sort => O(n log n) --- SC => O(1)
5. Quick Sort => O(n log n) --- SC => O(1)
6. Heap Sort => O(n log n) --- SC => O(1)
7. Radix Sort => O(Kn) --- SC => O(1)
