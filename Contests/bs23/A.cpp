//Input
//The first line contains three integers x, p, q(2 ≤ x ≤ 105; 1 ≤ p ≤ 3·105; 1 ≤ q ≤ 105).

//Each of the next p lines contains three integers ai, bi, ci(1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ x; ai ≠ bi; 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109).

//Each of the next q lines contains two integers ti and wi(2 ≤ ti ≤ x; 1 ≤ wi ≤ 109).Every city will,
//without a doubt, have at least one route to the capital.It's worth noting that there may be many highways connecting the two cities. There may also be many paths from the town of Jerry to the same town.

// Output
//Output one single integer,
//the maximum number of train lines that can be shut down such that the length of the shortest path from every town to town 11 should remain the same as before.
